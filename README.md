## Background
This project is a summary of the author's years of study and work practice.   
Most of the code has been actually run to ensure accuracy.   
Guys who point star regularly have opportunity to receive gifts by random algorithms. 😁
    
本项目是作者多年学习与工作实践的总结，绝大部分代码都经过实际运行保证准确无误。

## Suitable for
### for computer science guys
The author come from a non-CS major,   
and did not systematically study data structures, operating systems,   
design patterns and other courses during school.   
The relevant knowledge is to be studied systematically after work.    
So this project is especially suitable for non-CS majors.    
    
作者非CS专业科班出身，在校期间并未系统学习过数据结构,操作系统,设计模式等课程，    
相关的知识都是工作以后再进行系统学习。  
所以该项目特别适合非CS专业同学参考。  

###  for non-computer science guys
For CS majors, some of them have not studied mathematics courses systematically,     
such as matrix analysis, probability statistics, optimization, etc.   
The major of the author's master's degree is pattern recognition.   
And in the future work, he roughly understand which mathematical knowledge  
is the key and difficult point in algorithm learning and practice.  
Therefore, this project is also suitable for students majoring in CS  
  
CS专业的同学，有一部分没有系统学过数学方面的课程，比如矩阵分析，概率统计，最优化等。  
作者硕士阶段所学专业为模式识别，在以后的工作中，  
大致了解哪些数学知识是算法学习与实践中的重点与难点。  
因此，该项目也特别适合CS专业的同学。 


### for guys who need to put the algorithm online from 0 to 1
The algorithm is not just an offline train model,     
it can even be said that the offline train model is only a small part of the work.   
On the contrary, the corresponding engineering capabilities,   
code capabilities, and data capabilities are very important.    
Therefore, this project is especially suitable for guys   
who need to put the algorithm online from 0 to 1.  
      
算法并不只是离线train model，甚至可以说离线train model只是工作很小的一部分。  
相反对应的工程能力，代码能力，数据能力非常重要。    
因此该项目特别适合需要将算法从0到1怼上线的同学    


### for guys who need to solve various practical problems in actual work
The project not only contains algorithm theory, algorithm derivation,   
but also more engineering and data aspects.  
Most of them are actual problems encountered in work,   
which can provide you with reference ideas in practice.    
Therefore, this project is especially suitable for guys   
who need to solve various practical problems in actual combat.    
    
该项目不仅有算法理论，算法推导，还有更多工程以及数据方面的内容，  
大部分都是工作中遇到的实际问题，可以为大家实践中提供参考思路。      
因此该项目特别适合实战中需要解决各种实际问题的同学    

## CSDN address
https://blog.csdn.net/bitcarmanlee  

## Update
The layout and stability of github is higher than that of csdn.  
In the future, it will be prioritized to maintain the projects on github,  
and csdn will also keep synchronized updates.   
  
github的排版以及稳定性比csdn更高，以后优先维护github上的项目，CSDN也会保持同步更新。
